# SQL Query Filter Applications for Security and Employee Data Management

This repository provides SQL query examples focused on applying filters to enhance system security and manage employee data effectively. The project showcases SQL techniques used to address various security-related tasks and system updates, including:
	•	Investigating Failed Login Attempts: Filters for failed login attempts after business hours to identify potential security incidents.
	•	Analyzing Specific Login Dates: Retrieves login attempts from specified dates associated with suspicious activity.
	•	Filtering Login Locations: Filters for login attempts outside of Mexico to monitor unusual access patterns.
	•	Managing Departmental Employee Data: Retrieves employee data in specific departments (e.g., Marketing, Finance, Sales) for targeted system updates.
	•	Excluding Specific Departments: Filters employees outside of Information Technology to apply necessary updates.

These examples use SQL techniques, including the WHERE clause with AND, OR, and NOT operators, along with LIKE and wildcard % to match patterns. The repository serves as a guide for structuring SQL queries to retrieve critical information for security investigations and departmental data management.
